# **overview:**

**In this robot car, the task is to detect obstacles in front and avoid them. This process occurs continuously. An ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) is used to detect obstacles in front. If the robot car encounters an obstacle while moving forward, it stops and utilises the ultrasonic sensor attached to the servo motor to monitor both sides. It then proceeds along the path with fewer obstacles.**

**The speciality of this robot lies in the use of LEDs that change according to the movement of the car. The white LED lights up when moving forward. The red LED lights up when moving backwards. When its ultrasonic sensor turns to the left, the green LED lights up. When the ultrasonic sensor turns to the right, the blue LED lights up.**
